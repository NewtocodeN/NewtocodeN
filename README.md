- 👋 Hi, I’m @NewtocodeN a beginner who wants to learn code as much as possible. I do not have much to work on. I will be using some projects that are already made and try to learn how to recreate it and learn as I go.
- 👀 I’m interested in mastering code one step at time. In hopes of elevating into learning python which I've heard about.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, Javascript, and C++
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything for beginners so I can get more hands-on experience and become more knowledgeable.
- 📫 How to reach me ... discord:Walter B #4340
